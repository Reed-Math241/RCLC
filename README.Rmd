# RCLC

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RCLC (Reed College Library Checkout) is to provide an easy-to-use and insightful dataset with clear information about book checkouts from the Hauser Memorial Library from 2018 to 2020. Each observation in this data set corresponds to a borrow!

## Installation

The development version of Reed College Library Checkout is available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Reed-Math241/pkgGrpn) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Reed-Math241/pkgGrpn")
```

## Example
To import our dataset, just run:
``` r
library(RCLC)

checkouts <- RCLC::reed_checkouts

# OR

checkouts <- reed_checkouts


```
Here is an example of our data in action! This is a heatmap (over a calendar) of checkout data by day. Can you think of why 2020 looks so different from 2019?
